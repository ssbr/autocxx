#[cfg_attr(doc, aquamarine::aquamarine)]
/// Include some C++ headers in your Rust project.
///
/// This macro allows you to include one or more C++ headers within
/// your Rust code, and call their functions fairly naturally.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// C++ header (`input.h`):
/// ```cpp
/// #include <cstdint>
///
/// uint32_t do_math(uint32_t a);
/// ```
///
/// Rust code:
/// ```
/// # use autocxx_macro::include_cpp_impl as include_cpp;
/// include_cpp!(
/// #   parse_only
///     #include "input.h"
///     generate!("do_math")
///     safety!(unsafe)
/// );
///
/// # mod ffi { pub fn do_math(a: u32) -> u32 { a+3 } }
/// # fn main() {
/// ffi::do_math(3);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Configuring the build
///
/// To build this, you'll need to:
/// * Run the `codegen` phase. You'll need to use the `autocxx-gen`
///   crate or the `autocxx-build` crate to process the .rs code into C++ header and
///   implementation files. This will also generate `.rs` side bindings.
/// * Educate the procedural macro about where to find the generated `.rs` bindings. Set the
///   `AUTOCXX_RS` environment variable to a list of directories to search.
///   If you use `autocxx-build`, this happens automatically. (You can alternatively
///   specify `AUTOCXX_RS_FILE` to give a precise filename as opposed to a directory to search,
///   though this isn't recommended unless your build system specifically requires it
///   because it allows only a single `include_cpp!` block per `.rs` file.)
///
/// ```mermaid
/// flowchart TB
///     s(Rust source with include_cpp!)
///     c(Existing C++ headers)
///     cg(autocxx-gen or autocxx-build)
///     genrs(Generated .rs file)
///     gencpp(Generated .cpp and .h files)
///     rsb(Rust/Cargo build)
///     cppb(C++ build)
///     l(Linker)
///     s --> cg
///     c --> cg

///     cg --> gencpp
///     m(autocxx-macro)
///     s --> m
///     genrs-. included .->m
///     m --> rsb
///     gencpp --> cppb
///     cppb --> l
///     rsb --> l
/// ```
///
/// # Syntax
///
/// Within the brackets of the `include_cxx!(...)` macro, you should provide
/// a list of at least the following:
///
/// * `#include "cpp_header.h"`: a header filename to parse and include
/// * `generate!("type_or_function_name")`: a type or function name whose declaration
///   should be made available to C++.
/// * Possibly, `safety!(unsafe)` - see discussion of `unsafe` later.
///
/// Other directives are possible as documented in this crate.
///
/// # How to generate structs
///
/// All C++ types can be owned within a [UniquePtr][autocxx_engine::cxx::UniquePtr]
/// within Rust. To let this be possible, simply pass the names of these
/// types within [generate] (or just [generate] any function which requires these types).
///
/// However, only _some_ C++ `struct`s can be owned _by value_ within Rust. Those
/// types must be freely byte-copyable, because Rust is free to do that at
/// any time. If you believe your `struct` meets those criteria, you can
/// use [generate_pod] instead.
///
/// Use [generate] under normal circumstances, but [generate_pod] only for structs
/// where you absolutely do need to pass them truly by value and have direct field access.
///
/// This doesn't just make a difference to the generated code for the type;
/// it also makes a difference to any functions which take or return that type.
/// If there's a C++ function which takes a struct by value, but that struct
/// is not declared as POD-safe, then we'll generate wrapper functions to move
/// that type into and out of [UniquePtr][autocxx_engine::cxx::UniquePtr]s.
///
/// # Generated code
///
/// You will find that this macro expands to the equivalent of:
///
/// ```no_run
/// mod ffi {
///     pub fn do_math(a: u32) -> u32
/// #   { a+3 }
///     pub const kMyCxxConst: i32 = 3;
///     pub const MY_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITION: i64 = 3i64;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Built-in types
///
/// The generated code uses `cxx` for interop: see that crate for many important
/// considerations including safety and the list of built-in types, for example
/// [UniquePtr][autocxx_engine::cxx::UniquePtr] and
/// [CxxString][autocxx_engine::cxx::CxxString].
///
/// # Making strings
///
/// Functions that accept a `std::string` will actually accept anything that
/// implements a trait called `ffi::ToCppString`. That may either be a
/// `UniquePtr<CxxString>` or just a plain old Rust string - which will be
/// converted transparently to a C++ string.
///
/// This trait, and its implementations, are not present in the `autocxx`
/// documentation because they're dynamically generated in _your_ code
/// so that they can call through to a `make_string` implementation in
/// the C++ that we're injecting into your C++ build system.
///
/// None of that happens if you use `exclude_utilities`.
///
/// # Support for particular C++ features
///
/// ## Making other C++ types
///
/// Types gain a `make_unique` associated function. At present they only
/// gain this if they have an explicit C++ constructor; this is a limitation
/// which should be resolved in future.
/// This will (of course) return a `UniquePtr` containing that type.
///
/// ## Preprocessor symbols
///
/// `#define` and other preprocessor symbols will appear as constants.
/// At present there is no way to do compile-time disablement of code
/// (equivalent of `#ifdef`).
///
/// ## Integer types
///
/// For C++ types with a defined size, just go ahead and use `u64`, `i32` etc.
/// For types such as `int` or `unsigned long`, the hope is that you can
/// eventually use `std::os::raw::c_int` oor `std::os::raw::c_ulong` etc.
/// For now, this doesn't quite work: instead you need to wrap these values
/// in a newtype wrapper such as [c_int] or [c_ulong] in this crate.
///
/// ## String constants
///
/// Whether from a preprocessor symbol or from a C++ `char*` constant,
/// strings appear as `[u8]` with a null terminator. To get a Rust string,
/// do this:
///
/// ```cpp
/// #define BOB "Hello"
/// ```
///
/// ```
/// # mod ffi { pub static BOB: [u8; 6] = [72u8, 101u8, 108u8, 108u8, 111u8, 0u8]; }
/// assert_eq!(std::str::from_utf8(&ffi::BOB).unwrap().trim_end_matches(char::from(0)), "Hello");
/// ```
///
/// ## Namespaces
///
/// The C++ namespace structure is reflected in mods within the generated
/// ffi mod. However, at present there is an internal limitation that
/// autocxx can't handle multiple symbols with the same identifier, even
/// if they're in different namespaces. This will be fixed in future.
///
/// ## Overloads - and identifiers ending in digits
///
/// C++ allows function overloads; Rust doesn't. `autocxx` follows the lead
/// of `bindgen` here and generating overloads as `func`, `func1`, `func2` etc.
///
/// ## C++ classes - why do I get warnings?
///
/// autocxx is not currently able to distinguish a C++ struct from a C++ class.
/// It currently assumes they're all structs. This results in warnings
/// from most compilers, but could cause actual binary mismatches
/// on some ABIs. This is a temporary known limitation.
///
/// ## Forward declarations
///
/// A type which is incomplete in the C++ headers (i.e. represented only by a forward
/// declaration) can't be held in a `UniquePtr` within Rust (because Rust can't know
/// if it has a destructor that will need to be called if the object is `Drop`ped.)
/// Naturally, such an object can't be passed by value either; it can still be
/// referenced in Rust references.
///
/// ## Generic types
///
/// If you're using one of the generic types which is supported natively by cxx,
/// e.g. `std::unique_ptr`, it should work as you expect. For other generic types,
/// we synthesize a concrete Rust type, corresponding to a C++ typedef, for each
/// concrete instantiation of the type. Such generated types are always opaque,
/// and never have methods attached. That's therefore enough to pass them
/// between return types and parameters of other functions within `UniquePtr`s
/// but not really enough to do anything else with these types just yet. Hopefully,
/// this will be improved in future. At present such types have a name
/// `AutocxxConcrete{n}` but this may change in future.
///
/// # Internals
///
/// For documentation on how this all actually _works_, see
/// [IncludeCppEngine].

/// `safety!(unsafe_ffi)`
